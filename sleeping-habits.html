                  One of the most important part of a healthy lifestyle is sleeping well. Sometimes it can be hard to get your recommended sleep of 8 hours becuase of distractions and many other things.<br><br>
                  Its important to make sure of a few things before going to sleeep.
                 
                  Be consistent: Go to be the same time every night and get up the same time every morning thats including the weekends.<br><br>

                  Atmosphere: Make sure that the bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing and at a temperature you are comfortable with.<br><br>

                  Disturbances: Remove electronic devices such as mobile phones. This can keep the brain awake and make it challenging for the brain to relax and switch off.<br><br>

                  Large drinks and food: Do not eat large quantities of food before bed and also do not drink much alcohol before bed.<br><br>

                  Exercise: Physical activities during the day can make you more tired leading to better quality sleep.<br><br>

                  You should aim for at least 8 hours sleep a day. If you have 8 hours sleep a day that is often considered enough for your body upon waking up to do it's daily
                  tasks without a problem. <br><br>

                  Getting a good nights sleep is very important and can have a massive impact of your physical and mental health.
                  A lack of good sleep can lead to lack of motivation, the inability to do basic physical things and it may also lead to feelings of anxiety and depression.
