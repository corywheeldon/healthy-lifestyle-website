                  Imporoved sleep: Regular movement can make a person more tired at night leading to much better slepp.
                  It is often considered that at least 8 hours sleep is the rquirement for a good nights rest
                  and physical exercise can help achieve that no matter what.<br><br>

                  Physical exercise can also have a great effect on learning especially for children in school.
                  There are many advantages of exercise when it comes to learning, for example.<br><br>

                  Increased concentraion: studies show that children who participate in physical activity often are able to pay much better
                  attention in school, being able to concentrate to a deeper level.<br><br>

                  Better grades: studies have also shown that kids who are physically active often get
                  higher grades than those who dont.<br><br>

                  In order to start a good exercise routine its important to get a health checkup by a doctor so you can rule out any underlying physical problems that may cause you harm during your workouts.<br><br>
                  
                  2. Make a plan followed by setting realistic goals. You will be able to adjust your plan and your goals as your physical
                  fitness improves. <br><br>

                  3. Make it a habit. It becomes much easier in the future to do physical exercise if you stick to your created routine and dont give up on it.
                  Make sure to remember to pick a routine that works with your daily schedule. <br><br>
