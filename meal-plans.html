                 In a healthy lifestyle it is very important to have meal plans but many people do not know what should be part of a meal plan. 
                 For starters it is important to have variety, many people today do not eat a variety of foods but it is important to do so because it allows you to have an intake of many different vitamins and minerals.
                 Eating different types of fruit and vegetables is a very good way to achive this intake of different vitamnins and minerals.<br><br>
                 
                 Having a healthy meal plan will sure help your defences too. You should aim to include many healthy foods into your diet to help with your defences.<br><br>

                 containing vegetables and at least 2 containing fish. This will soon show overall improvements in your mood and life in general.<br><Br>
