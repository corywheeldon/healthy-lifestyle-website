                    Nutrition is very important so here are some tips to help you understand what a healthy diet should contain.
                    You should base your meals on high fibre starchy foods, these foods make up just over a third of what you eat. they include foods such as potatoes, bread, rice,pasta and cereals.
                    Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties,such as wholewheat pastas, brown rice or potatoes with the skin on.<br><br>

                    Eat lots of fruit and vegetabales. It is very important in a healthy diet to digest enough fruit and veg. you should aim to have at least 3 meals a week that include vegetables and you should start implementing fruit into your diet as snacks rather than relying on sweets and chocolate consistently.
                    Fruit and veg provide the body with the nutrients it needs to keep working at its best throughout the day.
                    Another good way to do this is to also have fruit juices which are a good intake of fruit at the same time as hydrating you. It is a good idea to drink no more than 1 glass a day as they contain alot of sugar and can therefore ruin your teeth.<br><br>
                    
                    Eat more fish, including oily fish. Fish contains many minerals and vitamins, it is also a good source of protein. You should aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including a portion of oily fish.
                    oily fish includes salmon, trout,herring,sardines,pilchards and mackerel.
                    Non oily fish is haddock,plaice,coley,cod,tuna and skate.<br><br>
                    
                    Saturated fat: you need some fat in your diet but it is very important ot take notice of what fat and how much of it you are taking in. The two types of saturated fats are saturated fats and unsaturated fats.
                    A high intake of saturated fats is bad for your cholestral and can therefore lead to heart disease. It is often said that men should take no more than 30g of saturated fat a day and women to take no more than 20g.
                    Saturated fats are found in many types of foods such as sausages, butter, cheese, cream, cakes, biscuits, lard and also pies.<br><br> 

                    Suagr: Taking in too much sugar can lead to tooth decay and also obesity. The types of sugar you should cut down on are free suagrs, these are sugars added to foods and drinks.
                    Foods to cut down on are cakes, fizzy drinks, puddings and pastries, sweets, and chocolates.<br><br>

                    Eat less salt. Adults should have no more than 6g a day of salt. Eating to much salt can lead to high blood pressure which can then lead to heart disease or stroke. 3 quatres of the salt you eat is already in the foods that you buy and thats before you may add salt to them. It is a good idea to use food labels in order to help you cut down on your salt intake.  Adults and children aged 11 or over should have no more than 6g a day of salt, any children younger than 11 should have even less than that.

                    Working out regularly is a very good thing and should be taken seriously. It is important to do any type of physical activity such as walking, running, weight lifting.
                     Working out often can also help in keeping you at a healthy weight. Try to eat less and work out more and you will suddenly feel much better in yourself.
                     Working out can also be very good for your mental health and can relieve a lot of stress that may have been built up in the day.<br><br>

                     Dont allow yourself to get thirsty. It is important to keep hydrated and to drink plenty of water throughout the day and try to also cut down on alcohol intake.
                     Getting hydrated can help your body wash out toxins and can make you feel more refreshed. It will also help prevent kidney or liver problems in the future as you get older.<br><br>
